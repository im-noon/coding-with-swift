## What is a Bundle Identifier?
The organization identifier is created using a reverse domain name. e.g. If your company website was www.appbrewery.co, the organization identifier would be co.appbrewery

The organization identifier is used in conjunction with the app name to create the Bundle Identifier which is used to uniquely identify your app amongst other apps on the Apple App Store. For example our app would be identified by co.appbrewery.I-Am-Rich

i.e. com [dot] domain name [dot] app name

Additionally, the bundle identifier is app-type specific, so the same bundle identifier cannot be used for both an iOS and macOS app.
